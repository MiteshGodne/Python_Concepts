## 🧭 Roadmap

The repository is organized into 5 distinct phases to ensure a smooth learning curve.

### 🔵 Stage 1: Introduction
* **Syntax & Variables:** Understanding dynamic typing and basic I/O.
* **Data Types:** Multiple data types and Type conversions.
* **Logic Control:** Mastering `if-elif-else`, `for` loop, and `while` loops.
* **Functions:** Scope, `*args`, `**kwargs`, and Lambda expressions.

### 🟢 Stage 2: Containers
* **Strings:** Strings, Fstrings, Docstrings and slicing.
* **Data Structures:** Deep dives into Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.
* **Methods:** Various methods used with Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.
* **Comprehensions:** List comprehensions, List Cloning, Unpacking, etc.

### 🟡 Stage 3: Important Concepts
* **Error Handling:** Exception handling with `try-except` blocks.
* **File Handling:** File operations such as read, write, etc. and Tell, Seek, With, etc.
* **One-liner Pythonic code:** such as shorthand `if-else`.
* **Functions:** Higher order Functions, Enumerate Functions and Lambda Functions.
* **Modules & Packages:** Understanding modules such as os, pypdf modules.
* **Context Managers:** Using the `with` statement and `__enter__/__exit__`.

### 🟠 Stage 4: Object Oriented Programming
* **OOP Pillars:** Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraciton and Polymorphism.
* **Decorators & Generators:** Advanced memory management and function wrapping.
* **Features:** Method overloading and overriding and constructors.
* **Methods:** Getter, setter, dunder, dir, __dict__, etc.
  
### 🔴 Stage 5: Advanced Python
* **Advance Python Collections:** namedtuple, defaultdict, counter.
* **Concurrency:** Introduction to `threading` and `multiprocessing`.
