print("Hello Python")

# History of Python => 
# 1. Python is a dynamically typed general purpose object oriented programming language made by Dutch Guido van Rossum in 1989 at NRI Netherlands, but was made available to public in Feb 20th 1991.
# 2. Named after monty python circus TV show.
# 3. Python repl = Read Evaluate Print Loop


# Major Versions Of Python =>
# 1. Python 0.9.0 - (Feb 1991) included exception handling, functions, data types, etc.
# 2. Python 1.0 - (Jan 1994) included functional programming, lambda, map, filter and reduce.
# 3. Python 2.0 - (Oct 2000) included list comprehensions, garbage collector and unicode support.
# 4. Python 3.0 / Py3k / 3000 - (Dec 2008) not backward compatible with 2.x
# 5. Python 3.12.1 - current version


# Features of Python =>
# 1. Simple and easy to learn.
# 2. Platform Independent due to PVM.
# 3. Freeware & Open Source.
# 4. Big Library Support.
# 5. Integration with other programming language is possible.
# 6. Case Sensitive.
# 7. Both Procedure and Object Oriented.
# 8. Dynamically Typed.
# 9. Interpreted Language & Compilation done by Python Interpreter.


# Applications of Python => 
# 1. Data Visualization - to create plots and graphical representation.
# 2. Data Analytics - to analyse data.
# 3. Ai and ML Development.     
# 4. Development of Web Applications.
# 5. Handle Databases.
# 6. Desktop, Games and Database Applications.
# 7. Network Programming & IOT.


# Limitations of Python =>
# 1. Not up to the mark because Interpreted language.
# 2. Not suitable for Mobile App Development.


# Flavours of Python =>
# 1. CPython - works with C
# 2. JPython - works with Java
# 3. IronPython - works with C# and DotNet
# 4. PyPy - improved performance due to JIT compiler inside PVM.
# 5. RubyPython - works with Ruby platform.
# 6. AnacondaPython - specially designed to handle large volume of data processing


# Python 2                         ||          Python 3
# print is a statement             ||  # print is a function
# strings are stored as ASCII      ||  # strings are stored as UNICODE
# int division gives int result    ||  # int division can give float result  
# exceptions enclosed in notations ||  # exceptions are enclosed in ()
# global var changes in for loop   ||  # global var value never changes
# xrange() is used                 ||  # range() is used
# raw_input() is [in str only]     ||  # input() is used only
# long data type was present       ||  # long is not present



# Pylance is a python language server.


# Modules in Python => Code Blocks already written by others.
# 1. External - Needs to be imported explicitly from 3rd party using "import" keyword.
# 2. Built In - Already associated with python interpreter.


# PIP => Performance improvement plan is a package management system used to install & manage software packages.
# 1. Commands =>
# >>> python : to check if python is installed and opens a REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) which executes python line by line  
# >>> python --version : to check python version 
# >>> pip install package_name : to install software modules/package
